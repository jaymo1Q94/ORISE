I am using this Github repository to track my progress in learning how to use GitHub. 
08.04.2022
I will be using the GitHub Docs Hello World Tutorial: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world

Cheat Sheet for Markdown Syntax: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/ TLDR: It is typical HTML formatting.

This repo will include resources for SpatioTemporal EPI like tutorials, side-projects, and notes.

On 08.04.2022, I added the RSpatial Data Science tutorial as I am slowly working through that tutorial. 

I plan to add my progress of that tutorial into GitHub as a stable respoitory.
