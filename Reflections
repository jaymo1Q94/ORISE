Learned how to:
1. Create a repository

Push commits into a file
Pull merge request into a file with new commits

I added the Spatial Data Manipulation code from the RSpatial tutorial into GitHub for safekeeping. 
Also added the packages I use for safekeeping -- which I am finding very helpful

You can use branches to isolate edits for a file that you want to update into a main branch. 
This allows you to create workflows with other collaborators where they can reveiw your commits and or establish approval
for your commits before pulling changes into a main branch. This helps with version control of projects I imagine.
